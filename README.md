# MSM4PCoD

2023-08-25

- The scripts beginning 00_MSM4PCoD_runScenarios will run all code (simulation + model fitting)
- Currently set up with normal observation processes for line-transect and PAM data in both the simulation and model
- After these are run, plotScenarios.R will generate plots of the iterations of the scenarios. Note that a directory matching the scenario ID must be manually created in the Figures folder. 
- For quick testing, try changing the number of simulations (nsim in the xls file) to e.g. 10 and comment out (donâ€™t run) the power calculation part of the routine (lines 115-116 in 00_MSM4PCoD_runScenarios)
- Note that because of file sizes/space constraints, not all results/figures have been added to this repo.
