# MSM4PCoD

2023-10-25

- The scripts beginning 00_MSM4PCoD_runScenarios will run all code (simulation + model fitting)
- Currently set up with normal observation processes for line-transect and PAM data in both the simulation and model
- After these are run, plotScenarios.R will generate plots of the iterations of the scenarios (currently set to plot the first 10 iterations).
- plotPower.R will plot the power resulting from a single scenario run
- combinePower.R will plot the power and generate a table of reference power values for 2+ combined scenario runs (i.e., combining the NULL and D50AB runs for a given scenario will cover a wider range of declines than either of those on their own).
- See MSM4PCoD_Task3C_Results_2023-10-24.Rmd for an example workflow to generate power plots (once scenarios have been run).
- For quick testing, try changing the number of simulations (nsim in the xls file) to e.g. 10 and comment out (donâ€™t run) the power calculation part of the routine (lines 115-116 in 00_MSM4PCoD_runScenarios)
- Note that because of file sizes/space constraints, not all results/figures have been added to this repo.
